** Status ** Data store: error, GeoServer: OK.
** Title ** A collection of hexagons.
** Contents ** This CSV resource contains hexagon polygons encoded as WKT in a column starting with "geom".
** Laundering ** Column names in this resource should not be modified: both PostgreSQL and GeoServer should be able to use these column names as is.
** Data store ** Uploading this resource to the CKAN data store should work. The WKT polygons should be converted to a PostGIS spatial column. However, this column does not have a spatial reference ID.
** GeoServer ** Publishing in GeoServer should work as well.
** Spatial information ** The CSV file does not contain information regarding the spatial extent or coordinate reference system, so this information must be added manually in the resource.
** To do ** Set spatial reference ID for spatial column
