A collection of 1024 random points. This Excel resource contains random strings, numbers, date/times and coordinates in longitude/latitude columns. Column names in this resource should not be modified: both PostgreSQL and GeoServer should be able to use these column names without any laundering actions. Uploading this resource to the CKAN data store should therefore not be a problem. The coordinates should be converted to a PostGIS spatial column and publishing in GeoServer should work as well. However, the Excel file does not contain information regarding the spatial extent or coordinate reference system, so this information has to be added manually in the resource.
